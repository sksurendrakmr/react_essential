Code Splitting
====

Traditionally, all the components in a react application would be bundled into one
single file called bundle.js.

This allow the browser to download the entire app once so that the user can navigate
seamlessly without having the need to make another HTTP request to the server.

As the application grew in size and more third party packages were installed, the bundle size
bloted up causing the app to have a long initial load time.

A single bundle file is split into smaller once and the user will only download the code that 
they need.

Code spitting === Incrementally downloading the application.

Since user doesn't need to download the entire application when all they need is 
a part of it for initial landing page.

Create-react-app with its webpack config support code splitting out of the box.

Steps 
1. Dynamically import components using react lazy and dynamic imports which is a modern
   javascript feature.
